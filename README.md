## My process
### Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
One major thing I learned from this project was how to center a div vertically and horizontally. I always heard how complicated this was, but now I experienced it firsthand. At first, I could only center it horizontally, but not vertically until I changed the viewport height from a suggestion online.

### Continued development
I want to get more comfortable with Flexbox as well as width and height properties.

### Useful resources
- [Resource 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-centering-using-flexbox) - This helped me with centering a div vertically.
